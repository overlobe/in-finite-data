# IN FINITE DATA

This repo is the basic online source for the ingenstion aspects of performing an instance of In Finite Data - a piece that uses audience input as source material for a sound performance. 

This version was undertaken and performed at the SDNOW conference in Melbourne in 2019

It is derived from the original composition titled ∞±∞ which dates from the early 2000's and is documented at [the internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210712063536/https://www.sounddesign.unimelb.edu.au/web/biogs/P000419b.htm)

This setup uses a page that shows an image randomly chosen from a set, with a text prompt for the user to respond to. It has an embedded page that connects to the speakpipe service that then records a message from the user and sends that audio to me. I then ise that audio in the performance.
